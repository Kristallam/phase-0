# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection
<p>
  1. Some time management and productivity ideas I learned about were Growth Mindset, where talents and ability can be developed through effort of good teaching and persistence. I also really liked the Pomodoro technique, where you set a timer and during that window you focus on what you are doing then when the timer goes off you can take a break then get back right into it.
  2. Time Boxing is where you perviously set a time and during that time you work towards your assignment/goal and when the time is up you stop working and reflect on what you accomplished during that time. I can use this technique during Phase 0 by setting my own "time boxes" where I focus on studying and doing the assignments. When the time is up I can see what I got done and see where I can improve. This will also help me track my progress to see how my habit develops across Phase 0.
  3. I am currently working full time while doing Phase 0 so I have to manage my time very strictly. Right now, I go to work come home, take about 30 minutes to workout and relax. After I will start on my assignments for Phase 0. I plan to integrate the Time Box technique to help me improve my time management even more so I can be as productive as possible.
  4. My current strategy is working but it can definitely be more organized. So hopefully with some techniques that I learned today I will be able to improve my time management and be more productive during Phase 0. Hopefully after Phase 0 some of these techniques will turn into habits to help even more when onsite begins.
  5. I plan to employ the Time Box/Promodoro technique into Phase 0. I really like the idea of setting a timer so you can remind yourself to stay focus and not to get side tracked. I plan to set increments of 30 minutes to begin with during Phase 0 and slowly adjust depending on my progress.
  6. My overall plan for Phase 0 is to go to work, come home workout/take a break, then spend around 3-4 hours per day on assignments for that week. I plan to break everything down on Monday so I can plan out the week more efficiently. I know that with working full time and doing Phase 0, I will have to be very organize and manage my time really well to stay up to speed.

## 1.2 The Command Line
<p>
  1. Shell is a computer program design to run by Unix. A bash is a Unix shell and command language.

  2. The most challenging thing for me to go through this material is this material is grasping all the terms and understanding when to use it. Memorizing all the commands is probably the hardest for me at the moment.

  3. I was able to successfully try all the commands in my Terminal

  4. In my opinion some important commands to know are mkdir, cd, ls, and of course man so get a manual of everything.

  -pwd - print working directory
  -ls - list directory
  -mv - move a file or directory
  -cd - change directory
  -../ - go back a directory
  -touch - changes time on a file
  -mkdir - make directory
  -less - page through a file
  -rmdir - remove directory
  -rm - removing a file
  -help - in windows to find info about commands

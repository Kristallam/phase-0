How do you define a local variable?
  You can define a local variable by going "var= 'variable details'"

How do you define a method?
  You define a method by "def method_name"

What is the difference between a local variable and a method?
  You think of a local variable as declaring something, a variable can be just about any dquence of letters and numbers. A method is being done by some object.

How do you run a ruby program from the command line? Using "irb"

How do you run an RSpec file from the command line? Using "rspec file_name.rb"

What was confusing about this material? What made sense? Formatting the address was a little bit hard for me. I think the main thing was learning how to read the spec file and understanding where to get the error. What made sense was what a variable is and what a method is.

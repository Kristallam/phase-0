# Factorial

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: Sibel Ergener ].

#Pseudocode
# Create loop that counts down until it reaches 1 (including 1)
# Assgin a value 1, so it knows where to begin
# UNTIL our counter hits the highest number it will continue to multiply
# It will END and then RETURN the final multiplied number

# Your Solution Below
def factorial(number)
  if number == 0
    p 1
 elsif
    i = 1
  num = i * number
    while number > i do
      num = i * num
      i += 1
    end
    p num
  end
end

#def factorial(number)
#  answer = 1
#  number.downto(1) do |i|
#    answer = answer * i
#  end
#end

<p> What does puts do? Puts returns nil and prints the output to the console with a new line </p>

<p> What is an integer? What is a float? Integers are numbers without decimal points and floats are numbers with decimal points.</p>

<p> What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming? In a float division your output could be 4.5 but in an interger division it will round down so your output would be 4. Basically think of having $3 and you want to buy candy bars that cost $2 each. With float you it comes out to be 1.5 but you can't buy half a candy bar. So that's where interger comes in and it round to only 1.</p>

<h1> Release 1</h1>
<p> What does puts do?

  Puts returns nil and prints the output to the console with a new line </p>

<p> What is an integer? What is a float?

 Integers are numbers without decimal points and floats are numbers with decimal points.</p>

<p> What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

  In a float division your output could be 4.5 but in an interger division it will round down so your output would be 4. Basically think of having $3 and you want to buy candy bars that cost $2 each. With float you it comes out to be 1.5 but you can't buy half a candy bar. So that's where interger comes in and it round to only 1.</p>

<h1> Release 2 </h1>
<p>
2.5



```ruby

puts 365 * 24

```


```ruby

puts 365 * 24 * 10 * 60

```

<p>
How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?


  Ruby handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division numbers in integers or in floats. If you want to use floats you have to add the decemial  when entering the number.
</p>
<p>
What is the difference between integers and floats?


  Integers are numbers without decimals and floats are numbers with decimals.
</p>
<p>
What is the difference between integer and float division?


  If you divide by between integers it will round down and if you divide by floats it will give you the decimal that comes after it.
</p>
<p>
What are strings? Why and when would you use them?


  String are letters that are linked together, you use them by making variable that can equal a long sentence or even a paragrph. You can link words together and make a sentence as well.
</p>
<p>
What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?


  Local variables are used to save a certain output for later on. You use this for words or solutions that are really long and you can just call upon the variable to get the same result.
</p>
<p>
How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?


  This challenge wasn't too bad, some of the challenges were just confusing to read. They weren't hard but I had to reread the instructions a couple of times. Yeah I did get some good reviews of the basics.

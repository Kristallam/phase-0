<!--
What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
  We continue to use the basic HTML skeleton. Also the <header>, <footer>, and <section> tag. Reason being is these are the basic HTML tags that we need to organize and structure the page.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
  Elements get laid out on a page based on the struture of it. So you have the <HTML> as the root and then you have the <head> as the parent, <body> as its child and so on.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
  We learned how to create a snippet for html5 in sublime, which included the meta charset. This is really useful and makes things a lot easier and I will for sure use it again.
